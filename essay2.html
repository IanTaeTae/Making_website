Climate Change
</h1>
<p>
Climate change is a type of change in temperature and climate patterns. For example, global temperature’s warming, weather patterns’ changing, and sea levels’  rising are climate changes. And humans have to care about climate changes. Because climate changes have some positive effects, but there are also some negative effects to us. As best known as climate change, global warming gives us only negative effects. So we “must” become that we control climate changes.<br>
There are two positive effects. First, change in farming. In a few areas, higher temperatures and more carbon dioxide could make it easier to grow crops or make them grow faster. But this doesn't happen everywhere, and it depends on other things like having enough water. Second, warmer weather in Some places. Some areas might get less cold in the winter. This could save more money on heating and make it easier to live there.<br>
However, there are also two negative effects of climate changes. First, global warming has so many bad effects. Sea levels’ increasing, desertification, water shortage, and amount of organisms decreasing comes from global warming. Through these effects, the Earth could be destroyed. And humans will lose our homes.<br>
Climate changes have some positive effects and negative effects. However, in my opinion, climate change isn't good for humans. All good effects only work for a short time, and they will become not necessary. So humans have to stop climate change. Global warming is the most dangerous, so we need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
