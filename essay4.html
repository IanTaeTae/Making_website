		Why is "atomic habits" a good book?
	</h1>
	<h3>Taeyoung Ahn</h3>
<p>
	Atomic habits can change our life. Good habits can help us develop. However, bad habits prevent our life from developing. A book named ‘Atomic Habits’ explains why Atomic Habits make our life grown-up, and how we can remove bad habits and make good habits. This essay will be showing three reasons why we have to read ‘Atomic Habits’.<br>
	First, this book teaches us two most important points. First point is ‘Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement’. For example, the author named James Clear said that if we improve one percent everyday, the result will be two hundred seventy three percent higher than normal (Inverarity, 2023).  Second point is ‘how to make new, good habits'. Four laws to make new, good habits. “Make it obvious”, “Make it attractive”,  “Make it easy”, and “Make it satisfying” (Inverarity, 2023). These four laws make us motivated and inspirational (Inverarity,2023).<br>
	Second, this book is not difficult to read. So if you have the motivation to develop yourself, you can read this book. My favorite sentence from this book is ‘Real change comes from the compound effects of hundreds of small decisions or habits that over time accumulate to produce remarkable results’(Mohamed Sanaulla, 2022). This sentence’s substance is good. Moreover, he shows his opinion clearly. I am not good at reading English, but this book was quite easy to read and understand. So I think anyone can read and understand this book easily.<br>
	Third, after reading this book, my lifestyle is changing now. Before reading this book, I always failed to apply new habits in my life. However, after reading this book, my way to adapt to a new habit changed. At the beginning of this year, I decided on some new habits through this book. For example, I decided to do some exercises, and read a bible in the morning. I followed the four laws when I created a new habit. And more concretely. Where will I do it, when will I do it? I am still learning, but my ways of thinking have become more developed than before. Actually it has become harder to forget to do a new habit. Habits make me more healthy and motivated (Ali Abdaal. 2024).<br>
	For these reasons, I really recommend you to read this book, ‘Atomic Habits’. If you care about developing your goals, or if you want to deliberately change your habits, you should read it (Ali Abdaal. 2024). The author, James Clear, will change your thinking, atomic habits, and your life’s result.
