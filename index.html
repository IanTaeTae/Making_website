	Why is Agriculture Important?
</h1>

<p>
	Agriculture is to produce crops and meats, which means farming. Farmers grow the crops and livestock. Farming can be challenging, it consumes a lot of time and effort. Humans heavily rely on agricultural conditions.<br>
	Agriculture is important for two reasons. First, agriculture helps maintain ecosystem balance. Moreover, it helps control the ecosystem because it provides food and shelter for animals and helps regenerate degraded areas. Second, agriculture is one of the largest sources of employment. People can work as a farmer, harvester, farm equipment mechanic, scientist, or any other jobs, agriculture provides employment opportunities for many people.<br>
	For these reasons, agriculture is very important to human society and the Earth. However, some people use pesticides which are harmful to farming. So, I think humans have to make some pesticides which are not bad for nature.
