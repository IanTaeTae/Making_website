		Power of small habits
	</h1>
<p>
	Small habits can change our life. If you get one percent better each day for one year, you will end up thirty-seven times better than a normal life. On the other hand, if you get one percent worse each day for one year, the result will be nearly zero (Clear, 2018).  Small habits make you develop. There are four laws to make a new, good habit (Clear, 2018). First law, “Make it obvious”. Second law, “Make it attractive”. Third law, “Make it easy”. Fourth law, “Make it satisfying”. You would not feel the development in the middle of course, but the final result will be explosive. It might take a long time to make a new habit in life, but that power will change your future (Clear, 2018).
